Dataset Description: Palmer Archipelago PenguinsThe Palmer Penguins dataset is a high-quality, structured dataset used for data exploration and visualization. It contains observations of three different species of penguins collected from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER.1Data DictionaryThe dataset consists of 344 observations across the following 7 variables:VariableDescriptionTypespeciesThe penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)CategoricalislandThe island where the observation was recorded (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)Categoricalbill_length_mmThe length of the penguin's bill (culmen) in millimetersNumericalbill_depth_mmThe depth of the penguin's bill (culmen) in millimetersNumericalflipper_length_mmThe length of the penguin's flipper in millimetersNumericalbody_mass_gThe body mass of the penguin in gramsNumericalsexThe sex of the penguin (Male, Female)CategoricalResearch ObjectiveThe primary goal of using this dataset for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to determine how physical characteristics (bill dimensions, flipper length, and weight) correlate with the species and environmental location (island). It is widely used in data science to demonstrate how multiple physical traits can be used to accurately classify different biological groups.Why this dataset is better for your assignment:Clear Separations: Unlike the "Tips" dataset where data points often overlap, penguins have distinct physical clusters (e.g., Gentoos are much larger than Adelies), which makes your Bi-variate and Multi-variate plots look much more professional.Noisy Data: It contains a few missing values (NaN), allowing you to show off your data cleaning skills by using df.dropna().Visual Appeal: The three species allow for distinct color-coding in your Pair Plots and FacetGrids.Would you like me to help you write a "Data Cleaning" section to add to your notebook before the graphs?
